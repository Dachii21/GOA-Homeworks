    <p>First of all, let's start off with who I am - My name is Dachi Chrdileli. I'm 14 years old. My hobbies are coding, playing a guitar and attending tbe MMA lessons. My school grades are also very good. I'm hoping that I'll be a very successful person one day. My hometown is Tbilisi. I'm planning to become a coder soon, so because of that I attend the GOA lessons. I usually try to do stuff by myself. That's all for now, if you want to learn more about me, go to <a href="aboutme.html">about me</a> page!</p>
